Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring Boot is a design pattern in which the framework automatically provides the required objects (dependencies) to a class, 
instead of the class creating them manually.

In simple terms:
You don’t create objects using new. Spring creates them and gives them to you.

Why Dependency Injection?
Without DI:
public class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository = new UserRepository();
}
